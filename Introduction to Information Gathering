Introduction to Information Gathering

Target Scoping - What you can and cannot test. This will specifically tell what you can target. 
Types: Domains (web based) and maybe subdomains
       IP (hosts or network range)
       Application (web or mobile, portal, api endpoint)


Passive vs Active Reconnaisance

Passive means theres no direction connection with the target. Low risk. Conducted first.
  Domain registration
  DNS Records
  Public Content
  Search Engine Results (Google Dorking)

Active means theres a direct connection. Increased Visibility. Performed after passive.
  Live Hosts
  Open Ports
  Running Services
  Network Repsonses

ALWAYS START WITH PASSIVE BEFORE ACTIVE!

What are we trying to do? Build a map of the target.
